- Is Cucumber a testing tool?
- No, Cucumber is a communication or a collaboration tool. It's not a testing tool. Adapting Cucumber as a testing tool or a replacement of an existing tool in a team will not result in the best usage of the tool. <a href = "https://cucumber.pro/blog/2014/03/03/the-worlds-most-misunderstood-collaboration-tool.html">Read Aslak's blog</a> for real good prespective on Cucumber.

- Project will contains <b>features</b> folder. Features folder contains feature files and <b>step_definitions</b> folder. Step definitions are inside <b>step_definitions</b> folder.
