Hands-on exercises
===============

Any simple exercise that can be done from 30 minutes to 2 hours will be ideal to be included here. Include exercise and solution at the same time.

Proposed format is - 

- Create a folder here with some meaningful name. You can include name of the exercise, description, complexity level, etc. to create a name
- Inside folder, 
    - Create readme.md that explains your exercise. Go in detail to describe what you expect and how. If you want to itemize your expected code to credit, go ahead and do it. If you want some extra credit expectations, include them.
- Create a folder named solution. Inside this folder will go your solved code. When you include code, make sure you provide some comments on why you would expect some code in certain way versus other way to get extra credit if you have. You can also include additional or supplment files like solution.md to explain your code if you wish.
- If your exercise can be solved in multiple way, you can either include it inside solution folder in a supplment files that I talked about, or you can create another folder with name 'Solution 2' or 'Solution with Hash' and include your code there.

So, a typical exercise with name 'implement page object' with one solution may look like -
