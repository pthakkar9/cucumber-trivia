===============

Inspired by <a href = "https://github.com/gregstallings/ruby-trivia">ruby-trivia</a>. This includes questions and exercises to quiz yourself and interview candidates appearing for cucumber role. I am practising Cucumber and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) for about 2 years now and I have never found any on-line resource that has either interview questions or some decent yet simple hands-on exercises. I always end up creating my own when interviewing candidates for my department. Hopefully, this place will fill that void.

Original idea is to start from basic questions and add advanced questions later on. Questions should be categorized. Right at this moment, I am categorizing them from complexity perspective. Later on, they can be categorized by some other perspective.
 
Some programming exercises are also to be included - something that you can use as hands-on exercise during interview or to sharpen your own skills. Any simple exercise that can be done from 30 minutes to 2 hours will be ideal to be included here.

Questions are here.
Exercies are in the Exercies folder.
